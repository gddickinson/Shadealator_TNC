# Stream Shade Calculation Results Files

These files contain the results of stream shade calculations exported from the "Shade-a-lator" tool, which is designed to estimate riparian shading effects on streams.

## Files Overview

### outdbf.dbf
This is a dBASE database file containing the actual shade calculation results that were exported from Shade-a-lator. The file stores tabular data with values for stream segments including their location coordinates, elevation, and calculated shade percentages.

### outdbf.dbf.xml
This is an XML metadata file that documents the creation process of the dBASE file. It shows:
- Created on June 22, 2017
- The file was generated by converting an Excel output file (`output2.xlsx`) from Shade-a-lator into a dBASE format using ArcGIS conversion tools
- The processing steps included CreateTable followed by ExcelToTable operations

### outdbf.cpg
This is a code page specification file that defines the character encoding (UTF-8) used in the dBASE file, ensuring proper display of text characters.

## Data Structure

The shade calculation results include the following fields:
- STREAM_ID: Identifier for the stream segment being analyzed
- FID_: Feature identifier for database referencing
- ELEVATION: Ground elevation at the sample point
- LATITUDE: North-south geographic coordinate
- LONGITUDE: East-west geographic coordinate
- SHADE: Calculated shade percentage at the stream point (the primary output of Shade-a-lator)

## Purpose and Usage

These files represent the final output from the Shade-a-lator modeling process, which calculates how much of the stream is shaded based on topography, vegetation characteristics, and solar position. The shade values are critical inputs for temperature modeling in aquatic systems, as they directly affect the amount of solar radiation reaching the water surface.

These results can be:
- Imported back into ArcGIS for spatial visualization using Script7 from the Georges_Tools.tbx toolbox
- Used in subsequent stream temperature modeling
- Applied in riparian restoration planning to identify areas where increased shading might be beneficial
- Used to assess potential climate change impacts on stream thermal regimes

The data is part of the Silver Creek digitization project and represents an important component in understanding and managing the thermal characteristics of this stream system.
